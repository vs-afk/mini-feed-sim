Project: Mini Feed Simulator
Description
Ever wonder how Instagram or X decides what you see?

In this project, you’ll build the engine behind a social feed using only core JavaScript. There is no browser UI and no frameworks. Your job is to design the logic that powers how posts are created, stored, liked, sorted, and filtered.

You will build the data layer of a social platform, the same kind of backend-style logic that real applications rely on before anything ever appears on a screen.

By the end of this project, you will have created a working feed simulator that can manage posts entirely through JavaScript.

Learning Objectives
Practice working with arrays and objects
Implement functions that manipulate data
Use array methods such as map, filter, and sort
Understand how social feeds store and organize posts
Build logic similar to what real applications use behind the scenes
Project Requirements
Your program should simulate a simple social media feed.

Post Structure
Each post should be represented as an object with the following properties:

id
username
content
likes
timestamp
Example:

{
  id: 1,
  username: "paul",
  content: "Just finished building my feed simulator!",
  likes: 12,
  timestamp: 1710000000
}
Core Features
1. Create Posts
Create a function called:

createPost(username, content)
This function should:

Generate a new post object
Assign a unique id
Set likes to 0
Assign a timestamp
Add the post to the feed array
2. Like a Post
Create a function called:

likePost(postId)
This function should:

Find the correct post
Increase its likes value by 1
3. Display the Feed
Create a function called:

getFeed()
This should return all posts.

4. Sort the Feed
Create two functions:

sortByNewest()
sortByLikes()
sortByNewest should return posts sorted by timestamp
sortByLikes should return posts sorted by likes
5. Filter Posts by User
Create a function:

getPostsByUser(username)
This should return only the posts created by that user.

Example Usage
Your code should allow logic like this:

createPost("alex", "Hello world")
createPost("paul", "Learning JavaScript is fun")

likePost(1)
likePost(1)

console.log(sortByLikes())
console.log(getPostsByUser("alex"))
Project Rules
Use arrays and objects
Use functions for each feature
Use array methods where appropriate
No DOM manipulation
No frameworks
